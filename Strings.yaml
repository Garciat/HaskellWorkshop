itemTitle: Strings
itemFilename: Strings.hs
itemDescription:
  Surprise! Strings are just lists of `Char`!
  This means that all the syntax and functions
  you''ve learned for manipulating lists is
  directly usable with Haskell''s strings.


  Many functions for working with strings
  (and not general lists) are also available
  globally. Moreover, the `Data.Char` module
  provides functions to manipulate characters.
