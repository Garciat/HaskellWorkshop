itemTitle: Simple Data Types
itemFilename: SimpleData.hs
itemDescription:
  Defining data types in Haskell is very easy.
  The syntax for both definition and usage is
  simple and intuitive.


  Unlike OO languages, values in Haskell are
  fully opaque in the sense that it is not
  possible to ''peek'' inside of them in any
  general way. For example, all **Java** objects
  have a `toString` method, and all **Python**
  objects may have their attributes inspected
  with the standard `dir` function.


  The way information (and computation!) is derived
  from Haskell values is via **pattern matching**.
