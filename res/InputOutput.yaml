itemDescription:
  Haskell is, in fact, a fantastic imperative language.
  It is possible to write entire programs in an imperative style
  without any pushback from the language.
  At times, problems may even demand this style. 
  Haskell provides a comprehensive set of tools to tackle these
  problems just like in any other imperative-only language.
