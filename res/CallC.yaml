itemTitle: Calling C
itemFilename: CallC.hs
itemDescription:
  Haskell compiles to native code and is very fast, but the truth
  of the matter is that C and C++ are the best choices for writing
  high-performance code.
  For this reason, essentially all languages provide a **C Foreign
  Function Interface** (FFI) that allows them to invoke C code with very
  little effort (sometimes). Haskell is no exception, and it does
  so quite seamlessly and efficiently.

  
  The Haskell Programming Language's syntax and semantics are
  described in high detail in a standard specification. The latest
  standard is **Haskell 2010**. The language's design and standard
  allow for **language extensions** as an evolution path for
  the language. The C FFI presented is one of these extensions.
