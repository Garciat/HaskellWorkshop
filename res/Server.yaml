itemTitle: REST Server
itemFilename: Server.hs
itemDescription:
  It is possible to write REST-style web API servers in Haskell.


  The code example makes of the `Servant` web API framework.
  It allows the programmer to describe the API as a _type_.
  This, coupled with advance type-level programming techniques,
  results in a type-safe API server implementation.
